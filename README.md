### Who am I? 

I am a B.Tech(IT) student at IGDTUW who works to make her dreams come true in reality.
I have gained industrial exposure during the first year of my graduation by working with The Education Tree as a member in their content development team.
I have a diverse skill set which includes web design and development, machine learning, data analysis and visualisation, public speaking, graphic designing, content management and social media marketing.
I also possess leadership skills which I exhibit being an active Rotaractor at Rotaract Club of Delhi Philanthropists where I am serving as the Club Secretary for Rota Year 2020-21.
In addition to building solutions for making lives easier by improvising technology, I also help the community as and whenever I can. 

### My positions of responsibility: 

    ðŸ‘½ Co-Creator, The WireUs Challenge www.thewireuschallenge.com 
    ðŸ‘½ Project Coordinator (ML/AI), DSC IGDTUW
    ðŸ‘½ Mentor, Web Development, LeanIN IGDTUW
    ðŸ‘½ Technical Lead, AI Club IGDTUW
    ðŸ‘½ Secretary, Rotaract Club of Delhi Philanthropists


### I am currently working on:
   :point_right:The WireUs Challenge, a hundred day challenge offered in 12 domains of development and design.
   
   :point_right: Finding a way to retain the knowledge of my third semester for life.
   
### I am currently learning 
   
   Learning never stops, you start learning right from the day you are born. Learning is not restricted to academic or professional skills but also essential values and life   skills.
   
   ðŸ“š German. I am quite fascinated by this language. I got a chance to take up a course of my own choice as a part of my third semester syllabus and I am grateful that NPTEL had this course to offer. The course starts from 18th September but I already am trying to figure it out on my own. Es ist eigentlich sehr gut! (It is actually very good!)
   
   ðŸ“š Sanskrit. The language of the Indian scriptures, the language of the holy Vedas, the mother of all languages. I was introduced to this language when I was 11 years old and I studied it until I was 16. Five years of understanding the language by renowned professors, of participating and winning in various competitions and of exploring the beauty of each and every shloka, I was drawn to it like a moth was drawn to the bulb. Unfortunately, I went out of practice for two years. But now I am brushing my skills and concepts once again to come back stronger and sweep away all the awards that are there to win! 
   
   ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms. First thought, why is it so hard and tricky? On a second thought, I felt maybe I am following a wrong approach. Now I have started with a great book (Data Structures using C and C++ by Yedidyah Langsam, Moshe J. Augenstein, Aaron M. Tenenbaum) and I think I will soon be able to add DSA to the skills I am pretty confident about.
